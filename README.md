Welcome to the official durian.js source tree! This is where the contents of the Durian project are held. If you did not know, Durian.js is a lightweight Javascript framework that allows for an easier time dealing with HTML by allowing for dynamic components with custom HTML tags. Let's throw out all the trash and garbage that causes slow apps and huge bundle sizes and start with plain old Javascript‚Äîno more Virtual DOMs or compilers, just HTML! How simple!

### üìú [LICENSE](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/durian.js/blob/main/LICENSE)

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Motivation

Most Javascript frameworks claim to be fast, reliable, safe and simple to learn. However, the hard truth is that many of them are very painful to work with. Often there are way too many abstractions and baggage that make learning and development slow. Virtual dom, compilers and hydration take up way too much space and create a hasel to deal with!

That's where Durian.js comes into play, Durian drops away the heavy baggage that large enterprise frameworks use and relies on pure HTML elements that take up minimal space, are reliable and have minimal working parts to worry about and just are easier to work with! Forget the hassle and move to Durian now! Remember, even plain HTML code can be easily migrated!
